## ✨ Features

### 🔍 Radiation Detection
- **Radiation Detection Device (RDD - Handheld)**  
  - Works like a mix of Mekanism’s Dosimeter & Geiger Counter  
  - Displays radiation level with its own HUD overlay  
  - Emits **beeping sounds** that can be toggled on/off (Shift + Right Click)  
  - Not tiered  

- **Stationary Radiation Detection Block**  
  - Placed in the world like a machine  
  - Detects radiation levels around it  
  - Displays color-coded numbers based on intensity  
  - Outputs **different redstone signal strengths** based on radiation level  
  - Has a **toggle button** to ignore natural background radiation  
  - Beeping alarm can be toggled on/off and integrates with Mekanism’s **redstone logic system**

### 🌍 Purification
- **Player Purification Device (PPD)**  
  - Worn or carried  
  - Actively purifies the **player’s radiation levels**  
  - Tiered system (Mk I → Mk IV)  
  - Higher tiers = faster purification and better efficiency  
  - Tank storage = **half the capacity of tier tanks**

- **Area Purification Device (APD)**  
  - Placed as a block to purify an **area around it**  
  - Tiered system (Mk I → Mk IV)  
  - Higher tiers = wider area, faster purification  
  - Tank storage = **half the capacity of tier tanks**

## 🛠 Crafting

Crafting follows a **progressive tier upgrade system**, inspired by Mekanism’s factories:

- **RDD (Handheld)** → crafted with a standard Radiation Detecting Device, control circuit, iron, and redstone.  
- **Stationary RDD Block** → crafted with osmium, redstone, the handheld RDD, a control circuit, and a machine casing.  
- **PPD / APD Tiers** → each tier is crafted by combining the previous tier device with osmium, redstone, and the matching tier of control circuit.  
- Tank storage for PPD and APD devices is **half of the Mekanism tiered tank capacity**.

## 📢 Community
This is an **open idea for the community**.  
Since I can’t code, I’m sharing it so modders and Mekanism fans can make it real.  

👉 Feel free to:  
- Suggest new features  
- Give balance feedback  
- Contribute code or assets  
- Fork the idea into your own project  

Together, we can make radiation gameplay in Mekanism **more immersive and fun**! 🚀
