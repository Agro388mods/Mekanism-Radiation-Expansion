# Mekanism-Radiation-Expansion

Welcome to **Mekanism: Radiation Expansion**!  

Many players have wanted a better radiation system in Mekanism. I, **Agro388**, came up with this idea for a mod, but I don’t know how to code it myself. That’s why this project is fully **community-driven**: anyone can contribute, suggest features, or provide feedback to help bring the mod to life.  

## Concept
Mekanism: Radiation Expansion adds new radiation-related mechanics, devices, and gameplay features inspired by the original Mekanism mod, all designed collaboratively with the community.

## Features
- Community collaboration: anyone can contribute code, ideas, or testing.
- Expanded radiation system with new devices and mechanics.
- Free and **non-commercial**.
- Open for suggestions and feedback from players.

## How to Contribute
1. Fork this repository.
2. Implement your changes, create new features, or fix issues.

4. Share ideas or feedback in the Issues or Discussions section.
